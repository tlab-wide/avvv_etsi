## what is CPM Protocol

The CPM (Collective Perception Message) protocol is a key component of the Collective Perception Service (CPS) 
analyzed in ETSI TR 103 562 V2.1.1 (2019-12). The CPS is a service that enables vehicles to share information
about their surroundings, such as road conditions, traffic, and weather, with other vehicles and infrastructure. The CPM protocol is used to format and transmit this information between vehicles and infrastructure.
The CPM protocol is designed to be lightweight and efficient, allowing for the transmission of large amounts
of data in real-time. The protocol includes a header and payload, with the header containing information about
the message type, sender, and receiver, and the payload containing the actual data being transmitted.
Overall, the CPM protocol is a key component of the CPS, enabling the exchange of information between 
vehicles and infrastructure to improve safety, efficiency, and sustainability in transportation systems.
