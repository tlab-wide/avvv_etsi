# In the event of data set collisions the Wireshark entries have been given

#
# This file is in the same format as ethers(4) except that vendor names
# are truncated to eight characters when used with Wireshark, and
# that well-known MAC addresses need not have a full 6 octets and may
# have a netmask following them specifying how many bits of the address
# are relevant (the other bits are wildcards).  Also, either ":", "-",
# or "." can be used to separate the octets.
