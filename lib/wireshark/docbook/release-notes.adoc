= Wireshark {wireshark-version} Release Notes
// Asciidoctor Syntax Quick Reference:
// https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

This is an experimental release intended to test new features for Wireshark 3.6.

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What’s New

Many improvements have been made.
See the “New and Updated Features” section below for more details.

// === Bug Fixes

// The following bugs have been fixed:

//* wsbuglink:5000[]
//* wsbuglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cveidlink:2014-2486[]
//* Wireshark keeps banging out random chords on your piano and yelling “LIPS LIKE SUGUAR, SUGAR KISSES” because it was funny that one time at a party.

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 3.4.0:

* The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.55.
//They previously shipped with Npcap 1.31.

* A 64-bit Windows PortableApps package is now available.

* A macOS Arm 64 (Apple Silicon) package is now available.

* TCP conversations now support a completeness criteria, which facilitates the identification of TCP streams having any
  of opening or closing handshakes, a payload, in any combination. It is accessed with the new tcp.completeness filter.

* Protobuf fields that are not serialized on the wire (missing in capture files) can now be displayed with default values
  by setting the new 'add_default_value' preference. The default values might be explicitly declared in 'proto2' files,
  or false for bools, first value for enums, zero for numeric types.

* Wireshark now supports reading Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). A new extcap named ETW reader is created that now can open an etl file,
  convert all events in the file to DLT_ETW packets and write to a specified FIFO destination. Also, a new packet_etw dissector is
  created to dissect DLT_ETW packets so Wireshark can display the DLT_ETW packet header, its message and packet_etw dissector
  calls packet_mbim sub_dissector if its provider matches the MBIM provider GUID.

* "Follow DCCP stream" feature to filter for and extract the contents of DCCP streams.

* Wireshark now supports dissecting the rtp packet with OPUS payload.

* Importing captures from text files is now also possible based on regular expressions. By specifying a regex capturing a single
  packet including capturing groups for relevant fields a textfile can be converted to a libpcap capture file. Supported data
  encodings are plain-hexadecimal, -octal, -binary and base64.
  Also the timestamp format now allows the second-fractions to be placed anywhere in the timestamp and it will be stored with
  nanosecond instead of microsecond precision.

* Display filter literal strings can now be specified using raw string syntax,
  identical to raw strings in the Python programming language. This is useful
  to avoid the complexity of using two levels of character escapes with regular
  expressions.

* Significant RTP Player redesign and improvements (see Wireshark User Documentation,
  {wireshark-users-guide-url}ChTelPlayingCalls.html[Playing VoIP Calls] and
  {wireshark-users-guide-url}_rtp.html#ChTelRtpPlayer[RTP Player Window])
** RTP Player can play many streams in row
** UI is more responsive
** RTP Player maintains playlist, other tools can add/remove streams to it
** Every stream can be muted or routed to L/R channel for replay
** Save audio is moved from RTP Analysis to RTP Player. RTP Player saves what was played. RTP Player can save in multichannel .au or .wav.
** RTP Player added to menu Telephony>RTP>RTP Player

* VoIP dialogs (VoIP Calls, RTP Streams, RTP Analysis, RTP Player, SIP Flows) are non-modal, can stay opened on background
** Same tools are provided across all dialogs (Prepare Filter, Analyse, RTP Player ...)

* Follow stream is now able to follow SIP calls based on their Call-ID value.

* Follow stream YAML output format’s has been changed to add timestamps and peers information (for more details see the user’s guide,
{wireshark-users-guide-url}ChAdvFollowStreamSection.html[Following Protocol Streams])

* IP fragments between public IPv4 addresses are now reassembled even if they have different VLAN IDs. Reassembly of IP fragments
  where one endpoint is a private (RFC 1918 section 3) or link-local (RFC 3927) IPv4 address continues to take the VLAN ID into
  account, as those addresses can be reused. To revert to the previous behavior and not reassemble fragments with different VLAN IDs,
  turn on the "Enable stricter conversation tracking heuristics" top level protocol preference.

* USB Link Layer reassembly has been added, which allows hardware captures to be analyzed at the same level as software captures.

* TShark can now export TLS session keys with the --export-tls-session-keys option.

* Wireshark participated in the Google Season of Docs 2020 and the User’s Guide has been extensively updated.

* Format of export to CSV in RTP Stream Analysis dialog was slightly changed. First line of export contains names of columns as in other CSV exports.

* Wireshark now supports the Turkish language.

* The settings in the 'Import from Hex Dump' dialog is now stored in a profile import_hexdump.json file.

* Reload Lua plugins has been improved to properly support FileHandler.

* Display filter syntax:
** Protocols always parse unquoted strings as byte values. Before an expression such as "tcp contains ff.fg" would look for the string "ff.fg" if it does not
   match a valid byte array specification. Now this is a syntax error. Use double-quotes to match literal strings.
** For string comparisons literal byte arrays are always interpreted as unquoted literal strings. This avoids unexpected results with embedded NUL bytes.
   For example "http.user_agent contains aa:bb" tries to match "aa:bb". Avoid this usage, always use double-quotes: http.user_agent contains "\xaa\xbb".
** Regular expressions (using "matches" or "~") must be specified using character strings. It is a syntax error to omit the double-quotes around
   the regular expression. Before the syntax rules of an unquoted regex string could be difficult to predict.

* Corrected calculation of mean jitter in RTP Stream Analysis dialog and IAX2 Stram Analysis dialog

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system specific to that platform.
A list of third-party packages can be found on the
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform.
You can use menu:Help[About Wireshark,Folders] or `tshark -G folders` to find the default locations on your system.
