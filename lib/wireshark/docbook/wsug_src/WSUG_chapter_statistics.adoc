[[ChStatIntroduction]]

=== Introduction

Wireshark provides a wide range of network statistics which can be accessed via
the menu:Statistics[] menu.

These statistics range from general information about the loaded capture file
(like the number of captured packets), to statistics about specific protocols
(e.g. statistics about the number of HTTP requests and responses captured).

.General statistics

  - *Capture File Properties* about the capture file.

  - *Protocol Hierarchy* of the captured packets.

  - *Conversations* e.g. traffic between specific IP addresses.

  - *Endpoints* e.g. traffic to and from an IP addresses.

  - *I/O Graphs* visualizing the number of packets (or similar) in time.

.Protocol specific statistics

  - *Service Response Time* between request and response of some protocols.

  - Various other protocol specific statistics.

[NOTE]
====
The protocol specific statistics require detailed knowledge about the specific
protocol. Unless you are familiar with that protocol, statistics about it may
be difficult to understand.
====

Wireshark has many other statistics windows that display detailed
information about specific protocols and might be described in a later
version of this document.

Some of these statistics are described at
{wireshark-wiki-url}Statistics.

[[ChStatSummary]]

=== The “Capture File Properties” Dialog

General information about the current capture file.

.The “Capture File Properties” dialog
image::wsug_graphics/ws-capture-file-properties.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

This dialog shows the following information:

Details::
Notable information about the capture file.

File:::
General information about the capture file, including its full path, size, cryptographic hashes, file format, and encapsulation.

Time:::
The timestamps of the first and the last packet in the file along with their difference.

Capture:::
Information about the capture environment.
This will only be shown for live captures or if this information is present in a saved capture file.
The pcapng format supports this, while pcap doesn’t.

Interfaces:::
Information about the capture interface or interfaces.

Statistics:::
A statistical summary of the capture file.
If a display filter is set, you will see values in the _Captured_ column, and if any packets are marked, you will see values in the _Marked_ column.
The values in the _Captured_ column will remain the same as before, while the values in the _Displayed_ column will reflect the values corresponding to the packets shown in the display.
The values in the _Marked_ column will reflect the values corresponding to the marked packages.

Capture file comments::
Some capture file formats (notably pcapng) allow a text comment for the entire file.
You can view and edit this comment here.

btn:[Refresh]::
Updates the information in the dialog.

btn:[Save Comments]::
Saves the contents of the “Capture file comments” text entry.

btn:[Close]::
Closes the dialog

btn:[Copy To Clipboard]::
Copies the “Details” information to the clipboard.

btn:[Help]::
Opens this section of the User’s Guide.

[[ChStatResolvedAddresses]]

=== Resolved Addresses

The Resolved Addresses window shows the list of resolved addresses and their host names. Users can choose the `Hosts` field to display IPv4 and IPv6 addresses only. In this case, the dialog displays host names for each IP address in a capture file with a known host. This host is typically taken from DNS answers in a capture file. In case of an unknown host name, users can populate it based on a reverse DNS lookup. To do so, follow these steps:

. Enable `Resolve Network Addresses` in the menu:View[Name Resolution] menu as this option is disabled by default.

. Select `Use an external network name resolver` in the menu:Preferences[Name Resolution] menu. This option is enabled by default.

NOTE: The resolved addresses are not updated automatically after users change the settings. To display newly available names user have to reopen the dialog.

The `Ports` tab shows the list of service names, ports and types.

Wireshark reads the entries for port mappings from the `hosts` service configuration files. See <<ChAppFilesConfigurationSection>> section for more information.

.Resolved Addresses window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-resolved-addr.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

[[ChStatHierarchy]]

=== The “Protocol Hierarchy” Window

The protocol hierarchy of the captured packets.

.The “Protocol Hierarchy” Window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-stats-hierarchy.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

This is a tree of all the protocols in the capture. Each row contains the
statistical values of one protocol. Two of the columns (_Percent Packets_ and
_Percent Bytes_) serve double duty as bar graphs. If a display filter is set it
will be shown at the bottom.

The btn:[Copy] button will let you copy the window contents as CSV or YAML.

.Protocol hierarchy columns

Protocol::
This protocol’s name.

Percent Packets::
The percentage of protocol packets relative to all packets in the capture.

Packets::
The total number of packets of this protocol.

Percent Bytes::
The percentage of protocol bytes relative to the total bytes in the capture.

Bytes::
The total number of bytes of this protocol.

Bits/s::
The bandwidth of this protocol relative to the capture time.

End Packets::
The absolute number of packets of this protocol where it was the highest protocol in the stack (last dissected).

End Bytes::
The absolute number of bytes of this protocol where it was the highest protocol in the stack (last dissected).

End Bits/s::
The bandwidth of this protocol relative to the capture time where was the highest protocol in the stack (last dissected).

Packets usually contain multiple protocols. As a result more than one protocol will
be counted for each packet. Example: In the screenshot IP has 99.9% and TCP
98.5% (which is together much more than 100%).

Protocol layers can consist of packets that won’t contain any higher layer
protocol, so the sum of all higher layer packets may not sum up to the protocols
packet count. Example: In the screenshot TCP has 98.5% but the sum of the
subprotocols (TLS, HTTP, etc) is much less. This can be caused by continuation
frames, TCP protocol overhead, and other undissected data.

A single packet can contain the same protocol more than once. In this case, the
protocol is counted more than once. For example ICMP replies and many tunneling
protocols will carry more than one IP header.

[[ChStatConversations]]

=== Conversations

A network conversation is the traffic between two specific endpoints. For
example, an IP conversation is all the traffic between two IP addresses. The
description of the known endpoint types can be found in
<<ChStatEndpoints>>.

[[ChStatConversationsWindow]]

==== The “Conversations” Window

The conversations window is similar to the endpoint Window. See
<<ChStatEndpointsWindow>> for a description of their common features. Along with
addresses, packet counters, and byte counters the conversation window adds four
columns: the start time of the conversation (“Rel Start”) or (“Abs Start”),
the duration of the conversation in seconds, and the average bits (not bytes)
per second in each direction. A timeline graph is also drawn across the
“Rel Start” / “Abs Start” and “Duration” columns.

.The “Conversations” window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-stats-conversations.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

Each row in the list shows the statistical values for exactly one conversation.

_Name resolution_ will be done if selected in the window and if it is active for
the specific protocol layer (MAC layer for the selected Ethernet endpoints
page). _Limit to display filter_ will only show conversations matching the
current display filter. _Absolute start time_ switches the start time column
between relative (“Rel Start”) and absolute (“Abs Start”) times. Relative start
times match the “Seconds Since Beginning of Capture” time display format in the
packet list and absolute start times match the “Time of Day” display format.

The btn:[Copy] button will copy the list values to the clipboard in CSV
(Comma Separated Values) or YAML format. The btn:[Follow Stream...] button
will show the stream contents as described in <<ChAdvFollowStream>> dialog. The
btn:[Graph...] button will show a graph as described in <<ChStatIOGraphs>>.

btn:[Conversation Types] lets you choose which traffic type tabs are shown.
See <<ChStatEndpoints>> for a list of endpoint types. The enabled types
are saved in your profile settings.

[TIP]
====
This window will be updated frequently so it will be useful even if you open
it before (or while) you are doing a live capture.
====

// [[ChStatConversationListWindow]]

[[ChStatEndpoints]]

=== Endpoints

A network endpoint is the logical endpoint of separate protocol traffic of a
specific protocol layer. The endpoint statistics of Wireshark will take the
following endpoints into account:

[TIP]
====
If you are looking for a feature other network tools call a _hostlist_, here is
the right place to look. The list of Ethernet or IP endpoints is usually what
you’re looking for.
====

.Endpoint and Conversation types

Bluetooth:: A MAC-48 address similar to Ethernet.

Ethernet:: Identical to the Ethernet device’s MAC-48 identifier.

Fibre Channel:: A MAC-48 address similar to Ethernet.

IEEE 802.11:: A MAC-48 address similar to Ethernet.

FDDI:: Identical to the FDDI MAC-48 address.

IPv4:: Identical to the 32-bit IPv4 address.

IPv6:: Identical to the 128-bit IPv6 address.

IPX:: A concatenation of a 32 bit network number and 48 bit node address, by
default the Ethernet interface’s MAC-48 address.

JXTA:: A 160 bit SHA-1 URN.

NCP:: Similar to IPX.

RSVP:: A combination of various RSVP session attributes and IPv4 addresses.

SCTP:: A combination of the host IP addresses (plural) and
the SCTP port used. So different SCTP ports on the same IP address are different
SCTP endpoints, but the same SCTP port on different IP addresses of the same
host are still the same endpoint.

TCP:: A combination of the IP address and the TCP port used.
Different TCP ports on the same IP address are different TCP endpoints.

Token Ring:: Identical to the Token Ring MAC-48 address.

UDP:: A combination of the IP address and the UDP port used, so different UDP
ports on the same IP address are different UDP endpoints.

USB:: Identical to the 7-bit USB address.

[NOTE]
.Broadcast and multicast endpoints
====
Broadcast and multicast traffic will be shown separately as additional
endpoints. Of course, as these aren’t physical endpoints the real traffic
will be received by some or all of the listed unicast endpoints.
====

[[ChStatEndpointsWindow]]

==== The “Endpoints” Window

This window shows statistics about the endpoints captured.

.The “Endpoints” window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-stats-endpoints.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

For each supported protocol, a tab is shown in this window. Each tab label shows
the number of endpoints captured (e.g. the tab label “Ethernet &#183; 4” tells
you that four ethernet endpoints have been captured). If no endpoints of a
specific protocol were captured, the tab label will be greyed out (although the
related page can still be selected).

Each row in the list shows the statistical values for exactly one endpoint.

_Name resolution_ will be done if selected in the window and if it is
active for the specific protocol layer (MAC layer for the selected
Ethernet endpoints page). _Limit to display filter_ will only show
conversations matching the current display filter. Note that in this
example we have MaxMind DB configured which gives us extra geographic
columns. See <<ChMaxMindDbPaths>> for more information.

The btn:[Copy] button will copy the list values to the clipboard in CSV
(Comma Separated Values) or YAML format. The btn:[Map] button will show the
endpoints mapped in your web browser.

btn:[Endpoint Types] lets you choose which traffic type tabs are shown. See
<<ChStatEndpoints>> above for a list of endpoint types. The enabled
types are saved in your profile settings.

[TIP]
====
This window will be updated frequently, so it will be useful even if you open
it before (or while) you are doing a live capture.
====

// [[ChStatEndpointListWindow]]


[[ChStatPacketLengths]]

=== Packet Lengths

Shows the distribution of packet lengths and related information.

.The “Packet Lengths” window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-stats-packet-lengths.png[{medium-screenshot-attrs}]

Information is broken down by packet length ranges as shown above.

Packet Lengths::
The range of packet lengths.
+
Ranges can be configured in the “Statistics -> Stats Tree” section of the <<ChCustPreferencesSection,Preferences Dialog>>.

Count::
The number of packets that fall into this range.

Average::
The arithmetic mean length of the packets in this range.

Min Val, Max Val::
The minimum and maximum lengths in this range.

Rate (ms)::
The average packets per millisecond for the packets in this range.

Percent::
The percentage of packets in this range, by count.

Burst Rate::
Packet bursts are detected by counting the number of packets in a given time interval and comparing that count to the intervals across a window of time.
Statistics for the interval with the maximum number of packets are shown.
By default, bursts are detected across 5 millisecond intervals and intervals are compared across 100 millisecond windows.
+
These calculations can be adjusted in the “Statistics” section of the <<ChCustPreferencesSection,Preferences Dialog>>.

Burst Start::
The start time, in seconds from the beginning of the capture, for the interval with the maximum number of packets.

You can show statistics for a portion of the capture by entering a display filter into the _Display filter_ entry and pressing btn:[Apply].

btn:[Copy] copies the statistics to the clipboard.
btn:[Save as...] lets you save the data as text, CSV, YAML, or XML.

[[ChStatIOGraphs]]

=== The “I/O Graphs” Window

Lets you plot packet and protocol data in a variety of ways.

.The “I/O Graphs” window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-stats-iographs.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

As shown above, this window contains a chart drawing area along with a customizable list of graphs.
Graphs are saved in your current <<ChCustConfigProfilesSection,profile>>.
They are divided into time intervals, which can be set as described below.
Hovering over the graph shows the last packet in each interval except as noted below.
Clicking on the graph takes you to the associated packet in the packet list.
Individual graphs can be configured using the following options:

Enabled::
Draw or don’t draw this graph.

Graph Name::
The name of this graph.

Display Filter::
Limits the graph to packets that match this filter.

Color::
The color to use for plotting the graph’s lines, bars, or points.

Style::
How to visually represent the graph’s data, e.g. by drawing a line, bar, circle, plus, etc.

Y Axis::
The value to use for the graph’s Y axis. Can be one of:

Packets, Bytes, or Bits:::
The total number of packets, packet bytes, or packet bits that match the graph’s display filter per interval.
<<ChStatIOGraphsMissingValues, Zero values>> are omitted in some cases.

SUM(Y Field):::
The sum of the values of the field specified in “Y Field” per interval.

COUNT FRAMES(Y Field):::
The number of frames that contain the field specified in “Y Field” per interval.
Unlike the plain “Packets” graph, this always displays <<ChStatIOGraphsMissingValues, zero values>>.

COUNT FIELDS(Y Field):::
The number of instances of the field specified in “Y Field” per interval.
Some fields, such as _dns.resp.name_, can show up multiple times in a packet.

MAX(Y Field), MIN(Y Field), AVG(Y Field):::
The maximum, minimum, and arithmetic mean values of the specified “Y Field” per interval.
For MAX and MIN values, hovering and clicking the graph will show and take you to the packet with the MAX or MIN value in the interval instead of the most recent packet.

// io_graph_item.c says:
// "LOAD graphs plot the QUEUE-depth of the connection over time"
// (for response time fields such as smb.time, rpc.time, etc.)
// This interval is expressed in milliseconds.
LOAD(Y Field):::
If the “Y Field” is a relative time value, this is the sum of the “Y Field” values divided by the interval time.
This can be useful for tracking response times.

Y Field::
The display filter field from which to extract values for the Y axis calculations listed above.

SMA Period::
Show an average of values over a specified period of intervals.

The chart as a whole can be configured using the controls under the graph list:

btn:[{plus}]::
Add a new graph.

btn:[-]::
Add a new graph.

btn:[Copy]::
Copy the selected graph.

btn:[Clear]::
Remove all graphs.

Mouse drags / zooms::
When using the mouse inside the graph area, either drag the graph contents or select a zoom area.

Interval::
Set the interval period for the graph.

Time of day::
Switch between showing the absolute time of day or the time relative from the start of capture in the X axis.

Log scale::
Switch between a logarithmic or linear Y axis.

The main dialog buttons along the bottom let you do the following:

The btn:[Help] button will take you to this section of the User’s Guide.

The btn:[Copy] button will copy values from selected graphs to the clipboard in CSV
(Comma Separated Values) format.

btn:[Copy from] will let you copy graphs from another profile.

btn:[Close] will close this dialog.

btn:[Save As...] will save the currently displayed graph as an image or CSV data.

[TIP]
====
You can see a list of useful keyboard shortcuts by right-clicking on the graph.
====

[[ChStatIOGraphsMissingValues]]

[discrete]
==== Missing Values Are Zero

Wireshark's I/O Graph window doesn’t distinguish between missing and zero values.
For scatter plots it is assumed that zero values indicate missing data, and those values are omitted.
Zero values are shown in line graphs, and bar charts.

// No longer true as of eb4e2cca69.
// For _plain_ (Packets, Bytes, and Bits) scatter plots, it is assumed that zero values indicate missing data, and those values are omitted.
// Zero values are shown in line graphs, bar charts, and _calculated_ scatter plots.
// Scatter plots are considered calculated if they have a calculated Y axis field or if a moving average is set.

// If you need to display zero values in a scatter plot, you can do so by making the Y Axis a calculated field.
// For example, the calculated equivalent of “Packets” is a “COUNT FRAMES” Y Axis with a Y Field set to “frame”.

[[ChStatSRT]]

=== Service Response Time

The service response time is the time between a request and the corresponding response.
This information is available for many protocols, including the following:

* AFP

[[ChStatANCP]]

=== ANCP

The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) is an TCP based protocol, which operates between an Access Node and Network Access Server. The Wireshark ANCP dissector supports the listed below messages:

* Adjacency Message
* Topology Discovery Extensions, such as Port-Up and Port-Down Messages
* Operation And Maintenance (OAM) Extension, such as Port Management Message.

The ANCP window shows the related statistical data. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file.

[[ChStatBACnet]]

=== BACnet

Building Automation and Control Networks (BACnet) is a communication protocol which provides control for various building automated facilities, such as light control, fire alarm control, and others. Wireshark provides the BACnet statistics which is a packet counter. You can sort packets by instance ID, IP address, object type or service.

[[ChStatCollectd]]

=== Collectd

Collectd is a system statistics collection daemon. It collects various statistics from your system and converts it for the network use. The Collectd statistics window shows counts for values, which split into type, plugin, and host as well as total packets counter. You can filter, copy or save the data to a file.

[[ChStatDNS]]

=== DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) associates different information, such as IP addresses, with domain names. DNS returns different codes, request-response and counters for various aggregations. The DNS statistics window enlists a total count of DNS messages, which are divided into groups by request types (opcodes), response code (rcode), query type, and others.

.DNS statistics window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-dns.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

You might find these statistics useful for quickly examining the health of a DNS service or other investigations. See the few possible scenarios below:

* The DNS server might have issues if you see that DNS queries have a long request-response time or, if there are too many unanswered queries.
* DNS requests with abnormally large requests and responses might be indicative of DNS tunneling or command and control traffic.
* The order of magnitude more DNS responses than requests and the responses are very large might indicate that the target is being attacked with a DNS-based DDoS.

You can filter, copy or save the data into a file.

[[ChStatFlowGraph]]

=== Flow Graph

The Flow Graph window shows connections between hosts. It displays the packet time, direction, ports and comments for each captured connection. You can filter all connections by ICMP Flows, ICMPv6 Flows, UIM Flows and TCP Flows. Flow Graph window is used for showing multiple different topics. Based on it, it offers different controls.

.Flow Graph window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-flow-graph.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

Each vertical line represents the specific host, which you can see in the top of the window.

The numbers in each row at the very left of the window represent the time packet. You can change the time format in the menu:View[Time Display Format]. If you change the time format, you must relaunch the Flow Graph window to observe the time in a new format.

The numbers at the both ends of each arrow between hosts represent the port numbers.

Left-click a row to select a corresponding packet in the packet list.

Right-click on the graph for additional options, such as selecting the previous, current, or next packet in the packet list. This menu also contains shortcuts for moving the diagram.

Available controls:

request leads to the next.

.The “HTTP Request Sequences” window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-stats-http-requestsequences.png[{screenshot-attrs}]


[[ChStatHTTP2]]

=== HTTP2

Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 (HTTP/2) allows multiplexing various HTTP requests and responses over a single connection. It uses a binary encoding which is consisting of frames. The HTTP/2 statistics window shows the total number of HTTP/2 frames and also provides a breakdown per frame types, such as `HEADERS`, `DATA`, and others.

As HTTP/2 traffic is typically encrypted with TLS, you must configure decryption to observe HTTP/2 traffic. For more details, see the link:{wireshark-wiki-url}TLS[TLS wiki page].

[[ChStatSametime]]

=== Sametime

Sametime is a protocol for the IBM Sametime software. The Sametime statistics window shows the counter for message type, send type, and user status.

[[ChStatTCPStreamGraphs]]

=== TCP Stream Graphs

Show different visual representations of the TCP streams in a capture.

Time Sequence (Stevens):: This is a simple graph of the TCP sequence
number over time, similar to the ones used in Richard Stevens’ “TCP/IP
Illustrated” series of books.

Time Sequence (tcptrace):: Shows TCP metrics similar to the
http://www.tcptrace.org/[tcptrace] utility, including forward segments,
acknowledgements, selective acknowledgements, reverse window sizes, and
zero windows.

[[ChStatF5]]

=== F5

In F5 Networks, *TMM* stands for Traffic Management Microkernel. It processes all load-balanced traffic on the BIG-IP system.

The F5 statistics menu shows packet and byte counts for both `Virtual Server Distribution` and `tmm Distribution` submenus.

Each `Virtual Server Distribution` window contains the statistics for the following data:

* A line for each named virtual server name.
* A line for traffic with a flow ID and no virtual server name.
* A line for traffic without a flow ID.

Each `tmm Distribution` window contains the statistics for the following data:

* A line for each tmm, which contains:
** A line for each ingress and egress (should add to tmm total), which contains:
*** Traffic with a virtual server name.
*** Traffic with a flow ID and no virtual server name.
*** Traffic without a flow ID.


[[ChStatIPv4]]

=== IPv4 Statistics

Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is a core protocol for the internet layer. It uses 32-bit addresses and allows packets routing from one source host to the next one.

The menu:Statistics[IPv4] menu provides the packet counter by submenus:

* `All Addresses`. Divides data by IP address.
* `Destination and Ports`. Divides data by IP address, and further by IP protocol type, such as TCP, UDP, and others. It also shows port number.
* `IP Protocol Types`. Divides data by IP protocol type.
* `Source and Destination addresses`. Divides data by source and destination IP address.

You can see similar statistics in the menu:Statistics[Conversations] and menu:Statistics[Endpoints] menus.

[[ChStatIPv6]]

=== IPv6 Statistics

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a core protocol for the internet layer. It uses 128-bit addresses and routes internet traffic. Similar to <<ChStatIPv4>>, the menu:Statistics[IPv6] menu shows the packet counter in each submenu.
