== Telephony

[[ChTelIntroduction]]

=== Introduction

Wireshark provides a wide range of telephony related network statistics which
can be accessed via the menu:Telephony[] menu.

These statistics range from specific signaling protocols, to analysis of
signaling and media flows. If encoded in a compatible encoding the media flow
can even be played.

The protocol specific statistics windows display detailed information of
specific protocols and might be described in a later version of this document.

Some of these statistics are described at the
{wireshark-wiki-url}Statistics pages.

[[ChTelPlayingCalls]]

=== Playing VoIP Calls

The tool for playing VoIP calls is called <<ChTelRtpPlayer,RTP Player>>. It shows RTP streams and its waveforms, allows play stream and export it as audio or payload to file. Its capabilities depends on supported codecs.

==== Supported codecs

RTP Player is able to play any codec supported by an installed plugins. The codecs supported by RTP Player depend on the version of Wireshark you're using. The official builds contain all of the plugins maintained by the Wireshark developers, but custom/distribution builds might not include some of those codecs. To check your Wireshark follow this procedure:

* open menu:Help[About Wireshark] window
* switch to menu:Plugins[] tab
* select codec as menu:Filter by type[]

.List of supported codecs

==== Work with RTP streams - Playlist

Wireshark can be used for RTP stream analysis. User can select one or more streams which can be played later. RTP Player window maintains playlist (list of RTP streams) for this purpose.

Playlist is created empty when RTP Player window is opened and destroyed when window is closed. RTP Player window can be opened on background when not needed and put to front later. During its live, playlist is maintained.

When RTP Player window is opened, playlist can be modified from other tools (Wireshark windows) in three ways:

* button menu:Play Streams[Set playlist] clears existing playlist and adds streams selected in the tool.
* button menu:Play Streams[Add to playlist] adds streams selected in the tool to playlist. Duplicated streams are not inserted again.
* button menu:Play Streams[Remove from playlist] removes streams selected in the tool from playlist, if they are in the playlist.

.btn:[Play Streams] button with opened action menu
image::wsug_graphics/ws-tel-rtp-player_button.png[]

btn:[Play Streams] button can be clicked directly and opens RTP Player window directly with btn:[Set playlist] action. All actions are selectable by small down arrow next to button.

When playlist is empty, there is no difference between btn:[Set playlist] and btn:[Add to playlist]. When RTP Player window is not opened, all three actions above open it.

btn:[Remove from playlist] is useful e. g. in case user selected all RTP streams and wants to remove RTP streams from specific calls found with menu:VoIPCalls[].

Tools below can be used to maintain content of playlist, they contain btn:[Play Streams] button. You can use one of procedures (Note: btn:[Add to playlist] action is demonstrated):

* Open menu:Telephony[RTP > RTP Streams] window, it will show all streams in the capture. Select one or more streams and then press btn:[Play Streams]. Selected streams are added to playlist.
* Select any RTP packet in packet list, open menu:Telephony[RTP > Stream Analysis] window. It will show analysis of selected forward stream and its reverse stream (if btn:[Ctrl] is pressed during window opening). Then press btn:[Play Streams]. Forward and reverse stream is added to playlist.
** menu:RTP Stream Analysis[] window can be opened from other tools too.
* Open menu:Telephony[VoIP Calls] or menu:Telephony[SIP Flows] window, it will show all calls. Select one or more calls and then press btn:[Play Streams]. It will add all RTP streams related to selected calls to playlist.
* Open btn:[Flow Sequence] window in menu:Telephony[VoIP Calls] or menu:Telephony[SIP Flows] window, it will show flow sequence of calls. Select any RTP stream and then press btn:[Play Streams]. It will add selected RTP stream to playlist.

.Tools for modifying playlist in RTP Player window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-tel-playlist.png[]

[NOTE]
====
Same approach with set/add/remove actions is used for RTP Stream Analysis window. The playlist is there handled as different tabs in the window, see <<ChTelRTPAnalysis,RTP Stream Analysis>> window.
====

[[ChTelPlayingCallsLive]]

==== Playing audio during live capture

Decoding RTP payload and showing waveforms is time consuming task. To speedup it RTP Player window uses copy of packet payload for all streams in the playlist. During live capture the dialog is not refreshed automatically as other Wireshark dialogs, but user must initiate it.

The copy is created or refreshed and dialog updated:

* Every time window is opened.
* Every time a new stream is added or set.
* During live capture, when btn:[Refresh streams] is pressed.
* Every time live capture is finished/stopped by a user.

When capture file is opened (no live capturing), streams are read complete, no user action is required. Button btn:[Refresh streams] is disabled as it is useless.

When live capture is running, streams are read only till "now" and are shown. When stream is continuous and user would like to see additional part, they must press btn:[Refresh stream]. When the user ends live capture, view is refreshed and button is disabled.

[NOTE]
====
RTP Player dialog stays open even live capture is stopped and then started again. Play list stays unchanged. Therefore btn:[Refresh stream] tries to read same streams as before and shows them if they are still running. Past part of them (from previous live capture) is lost.
====

==== RTP Decoding Settings

RTP is carried usually in UDP packets, on random source and destination port. Therefore without "help" Wireshark can't recognize it and shows just UDP packets.  Wireshark recognizes RTP streams based on VoIP signaling, e. g. based on SDP message in SIP signaling. When signaling is not captured, Wireshark shows just UDP packets. There are multiple settings which helps Wireshark to recognize RTP even there is no related signaling.

You can use <<ChAdvDecodeAsFig,Decode As...>> function from menu:Analyze[Decode As...] menu or in mouse context menu. Here you can set that traffic on specific source or destination should be decoded as RTP. You can save settings for later use.

Use of menu:Decode As...[] menu works fine, but for many streams it is arduous.

You can enable heuristic dissector menu:rtp_udp[] in menu:Analyze[Enabled Protocols...]. See <<ChCustProtocolDissectionSection>> for details. Once menu:rtp_udp[] is enabled, Wireshark tries every UDP packet to decode as RTP. If decoding is possible, packet (and entire UDP stream) is decoded as RTP.

When RTP stream uses well know port, heuristic dissector ignores it. So you might miss some RTP streams. You can enable setting for udp protocol menu:Preferences[Protocols > udp > Try heuristic sub-dissectors first], see <<ChCustPreferencesSection>>. In this case heuristics dissector tries to decode UDP packet even it uses well known.

[NOTE]
====
Take into account that heuristics is just simple "test" whether packet can be read as RTP. It can be false positive and you can see decoded as RTP more UDP packets than expected.

When you enable menu:udp[Try heuristic sub-dissectors first], it increases possibility of false positives. If you capture all traffic in network, false positives rate can be quite high.
====

RTP Player must store decoded data somewhere to be able to play it. When data are decoded, there are audio samples and dictionary for fast navigation. Both types of data are stored in memory for default, but you can configure Wireshark to store it on disk. There are two settings:

* ui.rtp_player_use_disk1 - When set to FALSE (default), audio samples are kept in memory. When set to TRUE, audio samples are stored on temporary file.
* ui.rtp_player_use_disk2 - When set to FALSE (default), dictionary is kept in memory. When set to TRUE, dictionary is stored on temporary file.

When any data are configured to be stored on disk, one file is created for each stream. Therefore there might be up to two files for one RTP stream (audio samples and dictionary). If your OS or user has OS enforced limit for count of opened files (most of Unix/Linux systems), you can see fewer streams that was added to playlist. Warnings are printed on console in this case and you will see fewer streams in the playlist than you send to it from other tools.

For common use you can use default settings - store everything in memory. When you will be out of memory, switch ui.rtp_player_use_disk1 to TRUE first - it saves much more memory than ui.rtp_player_use_disk2.


==== VoIP Processing Performance and Related Limits

Processing of RTP and decoding RTP voice takes resources. There are raw estimates you can use as guidelines...

RTP Streams window can show as many streams as found in the capture. Its performance is limited just by memory and CPU.

RTP Player can handle 1000+ streams, but take into account that waveforms are very small and difficult to recognize in this case.

RTP Player plays audio by OS sound system and OS is responsible for mixing audio when multiple streams are played. In many cases OS sound system has limited count of mixed streams it can play/mix. RTP Player tries to handle playback failures and show warning. If it happens, just mute some streams and start playback again.

RTP Analysis window can handle 1000+ streams, but it is difficult to use it with so many streams - it is difficult to navigate between them. It is expected that RTP Analysis window will be used for analysis of lower tens of streams.

====

[[ChTelRtpPlayer]]

==== RTP Player Window

The RTP Player function is tool for playing VoIP calls. It shows RTP streams and its waveforms, allows play stream and export it as audio or payload to file. See related concepts in <<ChTelPlayingCalls>>.

Menu menu:Telephony[RTP > RTP Player] is enabled only when selected packed is RTP packet. When window is opened, selected RTP stream is added to playlist. If btn:[Ctrl] is pressed during menu opening, reverse RTP stream (if exists) is added to the playlist too.

.RTP Player window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-tel-rtp-player_1.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

RTP Player Window consists of three parts:

. Waveform view
. Playlist
. Controls

Waveform view shows visual presentation of RTP stream. Color of waveform and playlist row are matching. Height of wave shows volume.

Waveform shows error marks for Out of Sequence, Jitter Drops, Wrong Timestamps and Inserted Silence marks if it happens in a stream.

.Waveform with error marks
image::wsug_graphics/ws-tel-rtp-player_3.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

Playlist shows information about every stream:

* Play - Audio routing
* Source Address, Source Port, Destination Address, Destination Port, SSRC
* Setup Frame
** SETUP <number> is shown, when there is known signaling packet. Number is packet number of signaling packet. Note: Word SETUP is shown even RTP stream was initiated e. g. by SKINNY where no SETUP message exists.
** RTP <number> is shown, when no related signaling was found. Number is packet number of first packet of the stream.
* Packets - Count of packets in the stream.
* Time Span - Start - Stop (Duration) of the stream
* SR - Sample rate of used codec
* PR - Decoded play rate used for stream playing
* Payloads - One or more playload types used by the stream

[NOTE]
====
When rtp_udp is active, most of streams shows just RTP <number> even there is setup frame in capture.

When RTP stream contains multiple codecs, SR and PR is based on first observed coded. Later codecs in stream are resampled to first one.
====

Controls allow a user to:

* btn:[Start]/btn:[Pause]/btn:[Stop] playing of unmuted streams
* btn:[>>] enabling/disabling silence skipping
** Min silence - Minimal duration of silence to skip in seconds. Shorter silence is played as it is.
* Select btn:[Output audio device] and btn:[Output audio rate]
* Select btn:[Playback Timing]
** Jitter Buffer - Packets outside btn:[Jitter Buffer] size are discarded during decoding
** RTP Timestamp - Packets are ordered and played by its Timestamp, no Jitter Buffer is used
** Uninterrupted Mode - All gaps (e. g. Comfort Noise, lost packets) are discarded therefore audio is shorted than timespan
* btn:[Time of Day] selects whether waveform timescale is shown in seconds from start of capture or in absolute time of received packets
* btn:[Refresh streams] refreshes streams during live capture (see <<ChTelPlayingCallsLive>>). Button is disabled when no live capture is running.
* Inaudible streams
** btn:[Select] select all inaudible streams (streams with zero play rate)
** btn:[Deselect] deselect all inaudible streams (streams with zero play rate)
* btn:[Analyze] open <<ChTelRTPAnalysis,RTP Stream Analysis>> window. Actions btn:[Set], btn:[Add] and btn:[Remove] are available.
* btn:[Prepare Filter] prepare filter matching selected streams and apply it.
* btn:[Export] - See <<tel-rtp-export>>.

[NOTE]
====
RTP Player detects silence just by missing voice samples (Comfort Noise, interrupted RTP, missing RTP, ...) or when some streams are muted.
====

.RTP stream state indication
image::wsug_graphics/ws-tel-rtp-player_2.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

Waveform view and playlist shows state of a RTP stream:

. stream is muted (dashed waveform, menu:Muted[] is shown in Play column) or unmuted (non-dashed waveform, audio routing is shown in Play column)
. stream is selected (blue waveform, blue row)
. stream is below mouse cursor (bold waveform, bold font)

User can control to where audio of a stream is routed to:

* L - Left channel
* L+R - Left and Right (Middle) channel
* R - Left channel
* P - Play (when mono soundcard is available only)
* M - Muted

Audio routing can be changed by double clicking on first column of a row, by shortcut or by menu.

User can use shortcuts:

* Selection
** kbd:[Ctrl + A] - Select all streams
** kbd:[Ctrl + I] - Invert selection
** kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + A] - Select none
** Note: Common kbd:[Mouse click], kbd:[Shift + Mouse click] and kbd:[Ctrl + Mouse click] works too
* Go to packet
** kbd:[G] - Go to packet of stream under the mouse cursor
** kbd:[Shift + G] - Go to setup packet of stream under the mouse cursor
* Audio routing
** kbd:[M] - Mute all selected streams
** kbd:[Shift + M] - Unmute all selected streams
** kbd:[Ctrl + M] - Invert muting of all selected streams
* kbd:[P] - Play audio
* kbd:[S] - Stop playing
* kbd:[Del] or kbd:[Ctrl + X] - Remove all selected streams from playlist
* Inaudible steams
** kbd:[N] - Select all inaudible streams
** kbd:[Shift + N] - Deselect all inaudible streams

[[tel-rtp-export]]

===== Export

[NOTE]
====
menu:Export[] was moved from menu:RTP Stream Analysis[] window to menu:RTP Player[] window in 3.5.0.

Wireshark is able to export decoded audio in .au or .wav file format. Prior to version 3.2.0, Wireshark only supported exporting audio using the G.711 codec. From 3.2.0 it supports audio export using any codec with 8000 Hz sampling. From 3.5.0 is supported export of any codec, rate is defined by Output Audio Rate.
====

Export options available:

* for one or more selected non-muted streams
** From cursor - Streams are saved from play start cursor. If some streams are shorter, they are removed from the list before save and count of saved streams is lower than count of selected streams.
** Stream Synchronized Audio - File starts at the begin of earliest stream in export, therefore there is no silence at beginning of exported file.
** File Synchronized Audio - Streams starts at beginning of file, therefore silence can be at start of file.
* for just one selected stream
** Payload - just payload with no information about coded is stored in the file

Audio is exported as multi-channel file - one channel per RTP stream. One or two channels are equal to mono or stereo, but Wireshark can export e.g. 100 channels. For playing a tool with multi-channel support must be used (e.g. https://www.audacityteam.org/).

Export of payload function is useful for codecs not supported by Wireshark.

[NOTE]
====
Default value of btn:[Output Audio Rate] is btn:[Automatic]. When multiple codecs with different codec rates are captured, Wireshark decodes each stream with its own play audio rate. Therefore each stream can has different play audio rate. When export of audio is used in this case, it will fail because .au or .wav requires one common play audio rate.

In this case user must manually select one of rates in btn:[Output Audio Rate], streams will be resampled and audio export succeeds.
