== Working With Captured Packets

[[ChWorkViewPacketsSection]]

=== Viewing Packets You Have Captured

Once you have captured some packets or you have opened a previously saved
capture file, you can view the packets that are displayed in the packet list
pane by simply clicking on a packet in the packet list pane, which will bring up
the selected packet in the tree view and byte view panes.

You can then expand any part of the tree to view detailed information about each
protocol in each packet. Clicking on an item in the tree will highlight the
corresponding bytes in the byte view. An example with a TCP packet selected is
shown in <<ChWorkSelPack1>>. It also has the Acknowledgment number in the TCP
header selected, which shows up in the byte view as the selected bytes.

[[ChWorkSelPack1]]

You can also select and view packets the same way while Wireshark is capturing
if you selected “Update list of packets in real time” in the “Capture
Preferences” dialog box.

In addition you can view individual packets in a separate window as shown in
<<ChWorkPacketSepView>>. You can do this by double-clicking on an item in the
packet list or by selecting the packet in which you are interested in the packet
list pane and selecting menu:View[Show Packet in New Window]. This allows you to
easily compare two or more packets, even across multiple files.

Along with double-clicking the packet list and using the main menu there are a
number of other ways to open a new packet window:

- Hold down the shift key and double-click on a frame link in the packet
  details.
- From <<PacketListPopupMenuTable>>.
- From <<PacketDetailsPopupMenuTable>>.

[[ChWorkDisplayPopUpSection]]

=== Pop-up Menus

You can open a pop-up menu over the “Packet List”, its column heading,
“Packet Details”, or “Packet Bytes” by clicking your right mouse button
on the corresponding item.

=== Filtering Packets While Viewing

Wireshark has two filtering languages: _capture filters_ and _display filters_.
_Capture filters_ are used for filtering
when capturing packets and are discussed in <<ChCapCaptureFilterSection>>.
_Display filters_ are used for filtering
which packets are displayed and are discussed below.

Display filters allow you to concentrate on the packets you are interested in
while hiding the currently uninteresting ones. They allow you to only display packets
based on:

* Protocol

* The presence of a field

* The values of fields

* A comparison between fields

* ... and a lot more!

To only display packets containing a particular protocol, type the protocol name
in the display filter toolbar of the Wireshark
window and press enter to apply the filter. <<ChWorkTCPFilter>> shows an
example of what happens when you type _tcp_ in the display filter toolbar.

[NOTE]
====
Protocol and field names are usually in lowercase.
====

[NOTE]
====
Don’t forget to press enter or click on the apply display filter button after entering the filter
expression.
====


[[ChWorkTCPFilter]]

.Filtering on the TCP protocol
image::wsug_graphics/ws-display-filter-tcp.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

As you may have noticed, only packets containing the TCP protocol are now displayed,
so packets 1-10 are hidden and packet number 11
is the first packet displayed.

[NOTE]
====
When using a display filter, all packets remain in the capture file. The display
filter only changes the display of the capture file but not its content!
====

To remove the filter, click on the btn:[Clear] button to the right of the
display filter field. All packets will become visible again.

Display filters can be very powerful and are discussed in further detail in
<<ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection>>

It's also possible to create display filters with the
_Display Filter Expression_ dialog box. More information about
the _Display Filter Expression_ dialog box is available in
<<ChWorkFilterAddExpressionSection>>.


[[ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection]]

=== Building Display Filter Expressions

Wireshark provides a display filter language that enables you
to precisely control which packets are displayed. They can be used
to check for the presence of a protocol or field, the value of a field, or
even compare two fields to each other. These comparisons can be combined
with logical operators, like "and" and "or", and parentheses
into complex expressions.

The following sections will go into the display filter functionality in
more detail.

[TIP]
====
There are many display filter examples on the _Wireshark Wiki Display
Filter page_ at: link:{wireshark-wiki-url}DisplayFilters[].
====

==== Display Filter Fields

The simplest display filter is one that displays a single protocol.
To only display packets containing a particular protocol, type the protocol
into Wireshark's display filter toolbar. For example, to only
display TCP packets, type _tcp_ into Wireshark's display filter toolbar.
Similarly, to only display
packets containing a particular field, type the field
into Wireshark's display filter toolbar. For example, to only display
HTTP requests, type _http.request_ into Wireshark's display filter toolbar.

You can filter on any protocol that Wireshark supports. You can
also filter on any field that a dissector adds to the tree view, if the dissector
has added an abbreviation for that field. A full list of the available protocols
and fields is available through the menu item
menu:View[Internals,Supported Protocols].

// XXX - add some more info here and a link to the statusbar info.

==== Comparing Values

You can build display filters that compare values using a number of different
comparison operators. For example, to only display packets to or
from the IP address 192.168.0.1, use `ip.addr==192.168.0.1`.

A complete list of available comparison operators is shown in <<DispCompOps>>.

[TIP]
====
English and C-like operators are interchangeable and can be mixed within a filter string.

|bitwise_and|&|Bitwise AND is non-zero| `tcp.flags & 0x02`
|===

All protocol fields have a type. <<ChWorkFieldTypes>> provides a list
of the types with examples of how to use them in display filters.

[[ChWorkFieldTypes]]

===== Display Filter Field Types

Unsigned integer::
  Can be 8, 16, 24, 32, or 64 bits. You can express integers in decimal, octal,
  or hexadecimal. The following display filters are equivalent:
+
`ip.len le 1500`
+
`ip.len le 02734`
+
`ip.len le 0x5dc`

Signed integer::
  Can be 8, 16, 24, 32, or 64 bits. As with unsigned integers you can use
  decimal, octal, or hexadecimal.

Boolean::
  Can be 1 (for true), or 0 (for false).
+
A Boolean field is present whether its value is true or false. For example,
`tcp.flags.syn` is present in all TCP packets containing the flag, whether
the SYN flag is 0 or 1. To only match TCP packets with the SYN flag set, you need
to use `tcp.flags.syn == 1`.

Ethernet address::
  6 bytes separated by a colon (:), dot (.), or dash (-) with one or two bytes between separators:
+
`eth.dst == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`
+
`eth.dst == ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff`
+
`eth.dst == ffff.ffff.ffff`

IPv4 address::
  `ip.addr == 192.168.0.1`
+
Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR) notation can be used to test if
an IPv4 address is in a certain subnet. For example, this display
filter will find all packets in the 129.111 Class-B network:
+
`ip.addr == 129.111.0.0/16`

IPv6 address::
  `ipv6.addr == ::1`
+
As with IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses can match a subnet.

Text string::
  `http.request.uri == "https://www.wireshark.org/"`
+
Strings are a sequence of bytes. Functions like `lower()` use ASCII, otherwise
no particular encoding is assumed. String literals are specified with double
quotes. Characters can also be specified using a byte escape sequence using
hex \x__hh__ or octal {backslash}__ddd__, where _h_ and _d_ are hex and octal
numerical digits respectively:
+
`dns.qry.name contains "www.\x77\x69\x72\x65\x73\x68\x61\x72\x6b.org"`
+
Alternatively a raw string syntax can be used. Such strings are prefixed with `r` or `R` and treat
backslash as a literal character.
+
`http.user_agent matches r"\(X11;"`

Date and time::
`frame.time == "Sep 26, 2004 23:18:04.954975"`
+
`ntp.xmt ge "2020-07-04 12:34:56"`
+
The value of an absolute time field is expressed as a string, using one of the
two formats above. Fractional seconds can be omitted or specified up to
nanosecond precision; extra trailing zeros are allowed but not other digits.
The string cannot take a time zone suffix, and is always parsed as in the local
time zone, even for fields that are displayed in UTC.
+
In the first format, the abbreviated month names must be in English regardless
of locale. In the second format, any number of time fields may be omitted, in
the order from least significant (seconds) to most, but at least the entire
date must be specified:
+
`frame.time < "2022-01-01"`
+
In the second format, a `T` may appear between the date and time as in
ISO 8601, but not when less significant times are dropped.

[[ChWorkFilterExamples]]

===== Some Examples

----
udp contains 81:60:03
----
The display filter above matches packets that contains the 3-byte sequence 0x81, 0x60,
0x03 anywhere in the UDP header or payload.
----
sip.To contains "a1762"
----
The display filter above matches packets where the SIP To-header contains the string "a1762"
anywhere in the header.
----
http.host matches "acme\\.(org|com|net)"
----
The display filter above matches HTTP packets where the HOST header contains
acme.org, acme.com, or acme.net.
Comparisons are case-insensitive.
----
tcp.flags & 0x02
----
That display filter will match all packets that contain the “tcp.flags” field with the 0x02 bit,
i.e. the SYN bit, set.

==== Possible Pitfalls Using Regular Expressions

String literals containing regular expressions are parsed twice. Once by Wireshark's display
filter engine and again by the PCRE library. It's important to keep this in mind when using
the "matches" operator with regex escape sequences and special characters.

For example the filter expression `+frame matches "AB\x43"+` uses the string `+"ABC"+` as input
pattern to PCRE. However the expression `+frame matches "AB\\x43"+` uses the string `+"AB\x43"+`
as the pattern. In this case both expressions give the same result because Wireshark and PCRE
both support the same byte escape sequence (0x43 is the ASCII hex code for `C`).

An example where this fails badly is `+foo matches "bar\x28"+`. Because 0x28 is the ASCII
code for `(` the pattern input to PCRE is `+"bar("+`. This regular expression is syntactically
invalid (missing closing parenthesis). To match a literal parenthesis in a display filter regular
expression it must be escaped (twice) with backslashes.

Another common pitfall is using `\.` instead of `\\.` in a regular expression. The former
will match any character (the backslash is superfluous) while the latter will match a literal dot.

TIP: Using raw strings avoids most problem with the "matches" operator and double escapes.

==== Combining Expressions

You can combine filter expressions in Wireshark using the logical operators shown in <<FiltLogOps>>

[[FiltLogOps]]

.Display Filter Logical Operations
[options="header",cols="1,1,1,4"]
|===
|English |C-like    |Description    | Example
|and     |&amp;&amp;| Logical AND   | `ip.src==10.0.0.5 and tcp.flags.fin`
|or      |\|\|      | Logical OR    | `ip.src==10.0.0.5 or ip.src==192.1.1.1`
|xor     |^^        | Logical XOR   | `tr.dst[0:3] == 0.6.29 xor tr.src[0:3] == 0.6.29`
|not     |!         | Logical NOT   | `not llc`
|[...]   |          | Subsequence   | See “Slice Operator” below.
|in      |          | Set Membership| http.request.method in {"HEAD" "GET"}. See “Membership Operator” below.
|===

==== Slice Operator
Wireshark allows you to select a subsequence of a sequence in rather elaborate
ways. After a label you can place a pair of brackets [] containing a comma
separated list of range specifiers.
----
eth.src[0:3] == 00:00:83
----
The example above uses the n:m format to specify a single range. In this case n
is the beginning offset and m is the length of the range being specified.
----
eth.src[1-2] == 00:83
----
The example above uses the n-m format to specify a single range. In this case n
is the beginning offset and m is the ending offset.
----
eth.src[:4] == 00:00:83:00
----
The example above uses the :m format, which takes everything from the beginning
of a sequence to offset m. It is equivalent to 0:m
----
eth.src[4:] == 20:20
----
The example above uses the n: format, which takes everything from offset n to
the end of the sequence.
----
eth.src[2] == 83
----
The example above uses the n format to specify a single range. In this case the
element in the sequence at offset n is selected. This is equivalent to n:1.
----
eth.src[0:3,1-2,:4,4:,2] ==
00:00:83:00:83:00:00:83:00:20:20:83
----
Wireshark allows you to string together single ranges in a comma separated list
to form compound ranges as shown above.

==== Membership Operator
Wireshark allows you to test a field for membership in a set of values or
fields. After the field name, use the `in` operator followed by the set items
surrounded by braces {}. For example, to display packets with a TCP source or
destination port of 80, 443, or 8080, you can use `tcp.port in {80 443 8080}`.
The set of values can also contain ranges: `tcp.port in {443 4430..4434}`.

[NOTE]
====
The display filter
----
tcp.port in {80 443 8080}
----
is equivalent to
----
tcp.port == 80 || tcp.port == 443 || tcp.port == 8080
----
However, the display filter
----
tcp.port in {443 4430..4434}
----
is not equivalent to
----
tcp.port == 443 || (tcp.port >= 4430 && tcp.port <= 4434)
----
This is because comparison operators are satisfied when _any_ field
matches the filter, so a packet with a source port of 56789 and
destination port of port 80 would also match the second filter
since `56789 >= 4430 && 80 \<= 4434` is true. In contrast, the
membership operator tests a single field against the range condition.
====



Sets are not just limited to numbers, other types can be used as well:
----
http.request.method in {"HEAD" "GET"}
ip.addr in {10.0.0.5 .. 10.0.0.9 192.168.1.1..192.168.1.9}
frame.time_delta in {10 .. 10.5}
----

|lower   |Converts a string field to lowercase.
|len     |Returns the byte length of a string or bytes field.
|count   |Returns the number of field occurrences in a frame.
|string  |Converts a non-string field to a string.
|===

The `upper` and `lower` functions can used to force case-insensitive matches:
`lower(http.server) contains "apache"`.

To find HTTP requests with long request URIs: `len(http.request.uri) > 100`.
Note that the `len` function yields the string length in bytes rather than
(multi-byte) characters.

Usually an IP frame has only two addresses (source and destination), but in case
of ICMP errors or tunneling, a single packet might contain even more addresses.
These packets can be found with `count(ip.addr) > 2`.

The `string` function converts a field value to a string, suitable for use with operators
like "matches" or "contains". Integer fields are converted to their decimal representation.
It can be used with IP/Ethernet addresses (as well as others), but not with string or
byte fields.

For example, to match odd frame numbers:
----
string(frame.number) matches "[13579]$"
----

To match IP addresses ending in 255 in a block of subnets (172.16 to 172.31):
----
string(ip.dst) matches r"^172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1])\.[0-9]{1,3}\.255"
----

[[ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterMistake]]

==== A Common Mistake with !=

Using the != operator on combined expressions like `eth.addr`, `ip.addr`,
`tcp.port`, and `udp.port` will probably not work as expected. Wireshark
will show the warning “"!=" may have unexpected results” when you use it.

People often use a filter string like `ip.addr == 1.2.3.4`
to display all packets containing the IP address 1.2.3.4.

Then they use `ip.addr != 1.2.3.4` expecting to see all packets not containing the IP
address 1.2.3.4 in it. Unfortunately, this does _not_ do the expected.

Instead, that expression will even be true for packets where either the source or
destination IP address equals 1.2.3.4. The reason for this is because the
expression `ip.addr != 1.2.3.4` is read as “the packet contains a field
named ip.addr with a value different from 1.2.3.4”. As an IP datagram contains
both a source and a destination address, the expression will evaluate to true
whenever at least one of the two addresses differs from 1.2.3.4.

If you want to filter out all packets containing IP datagrams to or from IP
address 1.2.3.4, then the correct filter is `!(ip.addr == 1.2.3.4)` as it is read
“show me all the packets for which it is not true that a field named ip.addr
exists with a value of 1.2.3.4”, or in other words, “filter out all packets
for which there are no occurrences of a field named ip.addr with the value
1.2.3.4”.

[[ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterTransitional]]

==== Sometimes Fields Change Names

As protocols evolve they sometimes change names or are superseded by
newer standards. For example, DHCP extends and has largely replaced
BOOTP and TLS has replaced SSL. If a protocol dissector originally used
the older names and fields for a protocol the Wireshark development team
might update it to use the newer names and fields. In such cases they
will add an alias from the old protocol name to the new one in order to
make the transition easier.

For example, the DHCP dissector was originally developed for the BOOTP
protocol but as of Wireshark 3.0 all of the “bootp” display filter
fields have been renamed to their “dhcp” equivalents. You can still use
the old filter names for the time being, e.g. “bootp.type” is equivalent
to “dhcp.type” but Wireshark will show the warning “"bootp" is deprecated”
when you use it. Support for the deprecated fields may be removed in the future.

[[ChWorkFilterAddExpressionSection]]

=== The “Display Filter Expression” Dialog Box

When you are accustomed to Wireshark’s filtering system and know what labels you
wish to use in your filters it can be very quick to simply type a filter string.
However if you are new to Wireshark or are working with a slightly unfamiliar
protocol it can be very confusing to try to figure out what to type. The
“Display Filter Expression” dialog box helps with this.

[TIP]
====
The “Display Filter Expression” dialog box is an excellent way to learn how to write
Wireshark display filter strings.
====


[[ChWorkFilterAddExpression1]]

.The “Display Filter Expression” dialog box
image::wsug_graphics/ws-filter-add-expression.png[{screenshot-attrs}]
// Screenshot from Wireshark 3.1.1

When you first bring up the Display Filter Expression dialog box you are shown a tree
of field names, organized by protocol, and a box for selecting a relation.

Field Name::
Select a protocol field from the protocol field tree. Every protocol with
filterable fields is listed at the top level. You can search for a particular
protocol entry by entering the first few letters of the protocol name. By
expanding a protocol name you can get a list of the field names available for
filtering for that protocol.

Relation::
Select a relation from the list of available relation. The _is present_ is a
unary relation which is true if the selected field is present in a packet. All
other listed relations are binary relations which require additional data (e.g.
a _Value_ to match) to complete.
+
When you select a field from the field name list and select a binary relation
(such as the equality relation ==) you will be given the opportunity to enter a
value, and possibly some range information.

Value::
You may enter an appropriate value in the _Value_ text box. The _Value_ will
also indicate the type of value for the _Field Name_ you have selected (like
character string).

Predefined Values::
Some of the protocol fields have predefined values available, much like enumerations
in C. If the selected protocol field has such values defined, you can choose one
of them here.

Search::
Lets you search for a full or partial field name or description.
Regular expressions are supported.
For example, searching for “tcp.*flag” shows the TCP flags fields supported by a wide variety of dissectors, while “^tcp.flag” shows only the TCP flags fields supported by the TCP dissector.

Range::
A range of integers or a group of ranges, such as `1-12` or `39-42,98-2000`.

btn:[Help]::
Opens this section of the User’s Guide.

btn:[OK]::
When you have built a satisfactory expression click btn:[OK] and a filter string
will be built for you.

btn:[Cancel]::
You can leave the “Add Expression...” dialog box without any effect by
clicking the btn:[Cancel] button.

[[ChWorkDefineFilterSection]]

=== Defining And Saving Filters

You create pre-defined filters that appear in the capture and display filter bookmark menus (image:wsug_graphics/toolbar/filter-toolbar-bookmark.png[height=16,width=12]).
This can save time in remembering and retyping some of the more complex filters you use.

To create or edit capture filters, select menu:Manage Capture Filters[] from the capture filter bookmark menu or menu:Capture[Capture Filters...] from the main menu.
Display filters can be created or edited by selecting menu:Manage Display Filters[] from the display filter bookmark menu or menu:Analyze[Display Filters...] from the main menu.
Wireshark will open the corresponding dialog as shown in <<FiltersDialog>>.
The two dialogs look and work similar to one another.
Both are described here, and the differences are noted as needed.

[[FiltersDialog]]

.The “Capture Filters” and “Display Filters” dialog boxes
image::wsug_graphics/ws-filters.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

btn:[{plus}]::
Adds a new filter to the list.
You can edit the filter name or expression by double-clicking on it.
+
The filter name is used in this dialog to identify the filter for your convenience and is not used elsewhere.
You can create multiple filters with the same name, but this is not very useful.
+
When typing in a filter string, the background color will change depending on the validity of the filter similar to the main capture and display filter toolbars.

btn:[-]::
Delete the selected filter.
This will be greyed out if no filter is selected.

// XXX Asciidoctor doesn't seem to allow images in DL terms, otherwise we could use
// list-copy.template.png here.
btn:[Copy]::
Copy the selected filter.
This will be greyed out if no filter is selected.

btn:[OK]::
Saves the filter settings and closes the dialog.

btn:[Cancel]::
Closes the dialog without saving any changes.

[[ChWorkDefineFilterMacrosSection]]

=== Defining And Saving Filter Macros

You can define a filter macro with Wireshark and label it for later use.
This can save time in remembering and retyping some of the more complex filters
you use.

To define and save your own filter macros, follow the steps below:

. In the main menu select menu:Analyze[Display Filter Macros...]. Wireshark will open a corresponding dialog <<FilterMacrosDialog>>.
+
[[FilterMacrosDialog]]
+
.Display Filter Macros window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-filter-macros.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

. To add a new filter macro, click the btn:[{plus}] button in the bottom-left corner. A new row will appear in the Display Filter Macros table above.

. Enter the name of your macro in the `Name` column. Enter your filter macro in the `Text` column.

. To save your modifications, click the btn:[OK] button in the bottom-right corner of the <<FilterMacrosDialog>>.

To learn more about display filter macro syntax, see <<ChDisplayFilterMacrosSection>>.

[[ChWorkFindPacketSection]]

=== Finding Packets

You can easily find packets once you have captured some packets or have
read in a previously saved capture file. Simply select menu:Edit[Find
Packet...] in the main menu. Wireshark will open a toolbar between the
main toolbar and the packet list shown in <<ChWorkFindPacketToolbar>>.

==== The “Find Packet” Toolbar

[[ChWorkFindPacketToolbar]]

.The “Find Packet” toolbar
image::wsug_graphics/ws-find-packet.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

You can search using the following criteria:

Display filter::
  Enter a display filter string into the text entry field and click the btn:[Find] button.
  +
  For example, to find the three way handshake for a connection from host 192.168.0.1, use the following filter string:
+
----
ip.src==192.168.0.1 and tcp.flags.syn==1
----
+
The value to be found will be syntax checked while you type it in. If
the syntax check of your value succeeds, the background of the entry
field will turn green, if it fails, it will turn red. For more details
see <<ChWorkDisplayFilterSection>>

Hexadecimal Value::
  Search for a specific byte sequence in the packet data.
+
For example, use “ef:bb:bf” to find the next packet that contains the
link:{wikipedia-main-url}Byte_order_mark[UTF-8 byte order mark].

String::
  Find a string in the packet data, with various options.

Regular Expression::
  Search the packet data using link:{pcre2pattern-url}[Perl-compatible
  regular expressions]. PCRE patterns are beyond the scope of this
  document, but typing “pcre test” into your favorite search engine
  should return a number of sites that will help you test and explore
  your expressions.

[[ChWorkGoToPacketSection]]

=== Go To A Specific Packet

You can easily jump to specific packets with one of the menu items in
the menu:Go[] menu.

==== The “Go Back” Command

Go back in the packet history, works much like the page history in most
web browsers.

==== The “Go Forward” Command

Go forward in the packet history, works much like the page history in
most web browsers.

==== The “Go to Packet” Toolbar

[[ChWorkGoToPacketToolbar]]

.The “Go To Packet” toolbar
image::wsug_graphics/ws-goto-packet.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

This toolbar can be opened by selecting menu:Go[Go to packet...] from
the main menu. It appears between the main toolbar and the packet list,
similar to the <<ChWorkFindPacketToolbar,”Find Packet” toolbar>>.

When you enter a packet number and press btn:[Go to packet]
Wireshark will jump to that packet.

==== The “Go to Corresponding Packet” Command

If a protocol field is selected which points to another packet in the capture
file, this command will jump to that packet.

As these protocol fields now work like links (just as in your Web browser), it’s
easier to simply double-click on the field to jump to the corresponding field.

==== The “Go to First Packet” Command

This command will jump to the first packet displayed.

==== The “Go to Last Packet” Command

This command will jump to the last packet displayed.

[[ChWorkMarkPacketSection]]

=== Marking Packets

You can mark packets in the “Packet List” pane. A marked packet will be shown
with black background, regardless of the coloring rules set. Marking a packet
can be useful to find it later while analyzing in a large capture file.

Marked packet information is not stored in the capture file or anywhere
else. It will be lost when the capture file is closed.

You can use packet marking to control the output of packets when saving,
exporting, or printing. To do so, an option in the packet range is available,
see <<ChIOPacketRangeSection>>.

There are several ways to mark and unmark packets. From the menu:Edit[] menu
you can select from the following:

* menu:Mark/Unmark Packet[] toggles the marked state of a single packet.
  This option is also available in the packet list context menu.

* menu:Mark All Displayed[] set the mark state of all displayed packets.

* menu:Unmark All Displayed[] reset the mark state of all packets.

You can also mark and unmark a packet by clicking on it in the packet list
with the middle mouse button.

[[ChWorkIgnorePacketSection]]

=== Ignoring Packets

You can ignore packets in the “Packet List” pane. Wireshark will then
pretend that they not exist in the capture file. An ignored packet will
be shown with white background and gray foreground, regardless of the
coloring rules set.

Ignored packet information is not stored in the capture file or anywhere
else. It will be lost when the capture file is closed.

There are several ways to ignore and unignore packets. From the
menu:Edit[] menu you can select from the following:

* menu:Ignore/Unignore Packet[] toggles the ignored state of a single
  packet. This option is also available in the packet list context menu.

* menu:Ignore All Displayed[] set the ignored state of all displayed packets.

* menu:Unignore All Displayed[] reset the ignored state of all packets.

[[ChWorkTimeFormatsSection]]

=== Time Display Formats And Time References

While packets are captured, each packet is timestamped. These timestamps will be
saved to the capture file, so they will be available for later analysis.

A detailed description of timestamps, timezones and alike can be found at:
<<ChAdvTimestamps>>.

The timestamp presentation format and the precision in the packet list can be
chosen using the View menu, see <<ChUseWiresharkViewMenu>>.

The available presentation formats are:

* menu:Date and Time of Day: 1970-01-01 01:02:03.123456[] The absolute date and time
  of the day when the packet was captured.

* menu:Time of Day: 01:02:03.123456[] The absolute time of the day when the packet
  was captured.

* menu:Seconds Since Beginning of Capture: 123.123456[] The time relative to the
  start of the capture file or the first “Time Reference” before this packet
  (see <<ChWorkTimeReferencePacketSection>>).

* menu:Seconds Since Previous Captured Packet: 1.123456[] The time relative to the
  previous captured packet.

* menu:Seconds Since Previous Displayed Packet: 1.123456[] The time relative to the
  previous displayed packet.

* menu:Seconds Since Epoch (1970-01-01): 1234567890.123456[] The time relative to
  epoch (midnight UTC of January 1, 1970).

The available precisions (aka. the number of displayed decimal places) are:

* menu:Automatic (from capture file)[] The timestamp precision of the loaded capture file format will be
  used (the default).

* menu:Seconds[], menu:Tenths of a second[], menu:Hundredths of a second[],
  menu:Milliseconds[], menu:Microseconds[] or menu:Nanoseconds[] The
  timestamp precision will be forced to the given setting. If the
  actually available precision is smaller, zeros will be appended. If
  the precision is larger, the remaining decimal places will be cut off.

Precision example: If you have a timestamp and it’s displayed using, “Seconds
Since Previous Packet” the value might be 1.123456. This will be displayed
using the “Automatic” setting for libpcap files (which is microseconds). If
you use Seconds it would show simply 1 and if you use Nanoseconds it shows
1.123456000.

[[ChWorkTimeReferencePacketSection]]

==== Packet Time Referencing

The user can set time references to packets. A time reference is the starting
point for all subsequent packet time calculations. It will be useful, if you
want to see the time values relative to a special packet, e.g. the start of a
new request. It’s possible to set multiple time references in the capture file.

The time references will not be saved permanently and will be lost when you
close the capture file.

Time referencing will only be useful if the time display format is set to
“Seconds Since Beginning of Capture”. If one of the other time display formats
are used, time referencing will have no effect (and will make no sense either).

To work with time references, choose one of the menu:Time Reference[] items in
the menu:[Edit] menu or from the pop-up menu of the “Packet List” pane. See
<<ChUseEditMenuSection>>.

* menu:Set Time Reference (toggle)[] Toggles the time reference state of the
  currently selected packet to on or off.

* menu:Find Next[] Find the next time referenced packet in the “Packet List” pane.

* menu:Find Previous[] Find the previous time referenced packet in the “Packet
  List” pane.

[[ChWorkTimeReference]]

.Wireshark showing a time referenced packet
image::wsug_graphics/ws-time-reference.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

A time referenced packet will be marked with the string $$*REF*$$ in the Time
column (see packet number 10). All subsequent packets will show the time since
the last time reference.
