== NAME

captype - Prints the types of capture files

== SYNOPSIS

[manarg]
*captype*
[ *-h* ]
[ *-v* ]
<__infile__>
__...__

== DESCRIPTION

*Captype* is a program that opens one or more capture files and
prints the capture file type of each <__infile__>.

*Captype* is able to detect and read the same capture files that are
supported by *Wireshark*.
The input files don't need a specific filename extension; the file
format and an optional gzip, zstd or lz4 compression will be automatically detected.
Near the beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of xref:wireshark.html[wireshark](1) or
https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html
is a detailed description of the way *Wireshark* handles this, which is
the same way *Captype* handles this.
